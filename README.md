The Grogulator
--------------

Initial checkin. Not really set up for general use.
Code still contains pieces from Garmin sample code that ought
to be deleted...

A very simple Grogu themed watchface written in Monkey C.
Only tested on Forerunner 55.
Only ever built on Mac.
You'll need to create a developer key using the instructions at Garmin's web site.

Requirements:
* Garmin Monkey C development tools
* Sigma Five Marquee font
